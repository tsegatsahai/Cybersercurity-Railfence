# Symmetric Key Encryption/Decryption 

This program contains a symmetric key encryption and decryption algorithm using the C++ programming language. The user will have the option of using the **Polyalphabetic cipher algorithm** or the **Rail Fence cipher algorithm** to encrypt and/or decrypt a text. The user will be prompted to insert the file name of a text file containing the text they would like to encrypt (plain text) or decrypt (cipher text). This program then opens the text file and asks the user whether they would like to encrypt or decrypt. If the user picks the Polyalphabetic algorithm, the program will perform the encryption or decryption using three substitution ciphers. If the user picks the Rail Fence algorithm, the program will perform the encryption/decryption using loops. 

The Polyalphabetic cipher used in this program contains three encryption algorithm functions (M1, M2 and M3) and three decryption algorithm functions (M1D, M2D and M3D). The Rail Fence algorithm contains 3 for-loops for encryption and 3 for-loops for decryption. This program employs the use of associate arrays (maps), vectors, arithmetic operations and ASCII values. 

*This program can be compiled and executed on a devise that is equipped with a C++ compiler.*
